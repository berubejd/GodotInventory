# Another Game Inventory for  [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)

## Overview

While there are a few game inventory systems already available for [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) I wanted to better understand how the Godot UI worked and to implement something which would better fit the use case I faced.  This implementation tries to accomodate those goals but is sure to evolve, as well.
